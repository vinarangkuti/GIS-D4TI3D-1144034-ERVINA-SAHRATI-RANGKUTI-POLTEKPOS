I will be a variety of knowledge about Geographic Information Systems, GIS is a system for the management, storage, processing, analysis, and delivery (display) data related to the earth's surface. The system to be able to operate requires hardware (hardware) and software (software) are also human beings who operate (brain ware).
Geospatial is a spatial properties that are in the earth's surface, the surface of the earth either the top or bottom surface of the earth, where geospatial will show the location of an object or scene.
Latitude is a line that stretches from north to south, where these latitudes there is latitude north (N) and south latitude (LS), which measures the angle between a point to the equator.
