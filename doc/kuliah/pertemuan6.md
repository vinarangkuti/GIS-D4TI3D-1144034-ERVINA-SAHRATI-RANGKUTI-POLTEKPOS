>**GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM PROJECT - MEETING 6**
------------------------------------------------------

In the use of Geographic Information Systems, there are many among us who do not know how to use the data in the editor. At the 6th meeting of the Geographic Information System, I'll explain how to use editor. 
Editor functions for editing on a shapefile. Editor functions for editing on a shapefile. 
Example delete road. In addition there is also the editor of Writer, Writer is a method in shape file to create a new shp file (shp and dbt). 

Example :
Import shape file
Sf = shape file.editor(war.shp)
Sf.point(16,10,0,0)
Sf.record (‘padang’)
Sf.save
Sf.save (‘war.shp’)
a=shapefile.reoder(‘war.shp’)
a.recorders()
a.shapes().points
a.shape()[0]
a.shape()[0] points
[(10,0,10,0)]
