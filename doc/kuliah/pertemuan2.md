>**SPATIAL DATA
VECTOR DATA AND RASTER DATA**
---------------------------

	Spatial data present position or geographical location of an object on the Earth's surface, while the attribute data is data that mendeksripsikan or explain from an object. What can be done by a computer to manipulate the objects that are in the vector data and raster data, such as points, lines, and polygon geometry used in the data model.
	This section will explain about Spatial Data were divided into two, namely Raster and Vector Data. Raster data provides spatial information of what is happening everywhere in the form of generalized image. With this model, the real world is presented as a grid of cells are the same. Raster data is converted into geo-reference coordinates by means of registering the georeferencing system. As for the vector data, vector data is a dat which can display, placing and storing spatial data using points, lines, and polygons and their attributes.
	The existing data is a representation of the object face of the earth. According to the times map not only on the surface of the earth, but also thrive in the face of the earth in the air and at sea. Therefore, to further facilitate the people in view of vector data and raster data online made lah GIS applications in the form of vector data and raster data.
