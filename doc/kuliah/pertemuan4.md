>**MAKING METHOD AND CLASS RETRIEVE GEOSPATIAL DATA**
---------------------------

	
	In the use of Geographic Information Systems, there are many among us who do not know how to use the data retrieved on geospatial data. Padapertemuan 4th Geographical Information Systems I will explain how to use geospatial shapefile data using python programming language and also how to use classes and methods in python.
	While Geometry Standart ESRI:
1. Point is a point
2. Poly Line is the starting point and does not have an endpoint
3. Polygon is to have a starting point and end point

Shp file on some data such as :

1. Bbox is a boundary box (coordinates of four points) or view the existing boundary coordinates on the map.
2. Part is whether the record is part of another record / precahan relations.
3. Points is a coordinate point
4. Shapetype is geometric data types that have a standard number assigned by ESRI as number 1 for points, 2 for polygons, 3 to polyline, etc.
Examples exist on the link: shapefile.esri.
